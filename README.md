# Getting Started
To download the application, please click <a href='https://github.com/Lexian-droid/YT-DLP-SimpleGUI/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp-gui.exe'>Here</a> to download the latest version.

## Dependencies
Before we get started, We first need to ensure you have the required dependencies. The dependencies are:
- YT-DLP
- FFMPEG
- FFPROBE
I will now describe how to install these dependencies.

## YT-DLP
YT-DLP is automatically downloaded, so all you need to do is run the exe file called ``yt-dlp-gui.exe`` and after the splash screen disappears, wait until ``yt-dlp.exe`` appears in the application directory. Once done, close the application.
## FFMPEG
The simpliest way to get FFMPEG for this application, is to simply download it from it's source. We recommend downloading <a href='https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-essentials.7z'>This</a> version from gyan.dev, as it is all you need.

- Once downloaded, all you have to do is open the newly downloaded 7z archive (This step might require 7zip if you haven't got it already.)
- Once opened, click on the folder labeled, "bin"
- Extract the three files, ``ffprobe.exe``, ``ffmpeg.exe``, ``ffplay.exe`` and **paste** them into the application directory.

Once completed, setup is done. You are now ready to run the application again, and to use the GUI.

## Option Fields
Now that you have the GUI fully set up, you are now ready to download videos. However, as you might notice, there are many fields and options, I will go ahead and briefly explain all of these fields, as they are really simple to understand.

- ``Video URL`` - This is the YouTube video URL that you wish to download.
- ``Convert`` - This is the format your video will be saved in.
- ``FFMPEG Location`` - If the above steps were completed successfully, this field will automatically populate, however, If not, you can select the folder button next to it.
- ``Custom Params (Advanced)`` - This is for Advanced users, it is to allow you to directly insert your own parameters into the script. This can be leaved empty.
- ``Command Preview`` - This is your command as it will be executed.
- ``Download Button`` - Click this once all fields are completely populated.

## That is it!
Now you have just downloaded your first video, congratulations! If you have any issues, please feel free to visit the <a href='https://github.com/Lexian-droid/YT-DLP-SimpleGUI/issues'>Issues</a> tab.
